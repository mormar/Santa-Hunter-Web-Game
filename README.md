## Goal
Creating together first web game for the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship 2017/2018.

## Reasons behind the project
We would like to inspire other students to create and share their projects.
We would like to make some funny christmas game for students. 

## What did we learn? 
After this project we've learnd how to use phaser to make game that obvious. We have learned how to create custom sprites and tilemap.
